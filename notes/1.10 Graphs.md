# Graphs

- a _simple_ graph is a graph in which there are no loops and only single edges are allowed
- a _regular_ graph is one in which each vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e. the same degree)
- a _complete_ graph is a simple graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge

Notation: $n$ is the number of vertices, i.e. $|V|$, $m$ is the number of edges, i.e. $|E|$.

Graph algorithm performance is typically a function of the number of vertices and the number of edges.

For a connected graph with no parallel edges (i.e. each pair of vertices has only zero or one edge between it), $m$ is somewhere between $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n^2)$.

Generally, a graph is said to be _sparse_ if $m$ is $O(n)$ or close to it (that is, it has the lower end of number of edges). If $m$ is closer to $O(n^2)$, this is generally said to be a _dense_ graph.

An adjacency matrix requires $\Theta(n^2)$ space. If the graph is sparse, this is a waste of space, and an adjacency list is more appropriate - you have an array of vertices and an array of edges. Each edge points to its endpoints, and each vertex points to edges incident on it. This requires $\Theta(m+n)$ space (because the array of vertices takes $\Theta(n)$ space and the arrays of edges, edge-to-endpoints, and vertex-to-edges each take $\Theta(m)$, for $\Theta(n+3m) = \Theta(m+n)$), so it is better for sparse graphs.
