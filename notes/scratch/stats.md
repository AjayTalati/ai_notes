_Likelihood_ is just the name for the probability of observed data as a function of the parameters.

The maximum likelihood estimate is just the parameter which maximizes the likelihood, which can be done by computing the derivative of the likelihood and solving for zero. It is a very common way of estimating parameters.

The Expectation-Maximation (EM) algorithm is a way of computing a maximum likelihood estimate for situations where some variables may be hidden.
