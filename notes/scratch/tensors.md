__Tensors__ are generalizations of scalars and vectors. A tensor is distinguished by its __rank__, which is the number of indices it has. A scalar is a $0^{th}$-rank tensor (it has no indices), a vector is a $1^{th}$-rank tensor, i.e. its components are accessed by one index, e.g. $x_i$, and a matrix is a $2^{th}$-rank tensor, i.e. its components are accessed by two indices, e.g. $X_{i,j}$, and so on.

Just as we have scalar and vector fields, we also have __tensor fields__.
