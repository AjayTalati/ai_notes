# Agent-Based Models

Agent-based models include:

- individual agents model intelligent behavior, usually with a simple set of rules
- the agents are situated in some space or a network and interact with each other locally
- the agents usually have imperfect, local information
- there is usually variability between agents
- often there are random elements, either among the agents or in the world

## Brownian agents

A _Brownian agent_ is described by a set of state variables $u_i^{(k)}$ where $i \in [1, \dots, N]$ refers to the individual agent $i$ and $k$ indicates the different variables.

These state variables may be _external_, which are observable from outside the agent, or _internal degrees of freedom_ that must be inferred from observable actions.

The state variables can change over time due to the environment or internal dynamics. We can generally express the dynamics of the state variables as follows:

$$
\frac{d u_i^{(k)}}{dt} = f_i^{(k)} + \mathcal F_i^{\text{stoch}}
$$

The _principle of causality_ is represented here: any _effect_ such as a temporal change of variable $u$ has some _causes_ on the right-hand side of the equation; such causes are described as a _superposition_ of deterministic and stochastic influences imposed on the agent $i$.

In this formulation, $f_i^{(k)}$ is a deterministic term representing influences that can be specified on the time and length scale of the agent, whereas $F_i^{\text{stoch}}$ is a stochastic term which represents influences that exist, but not observable on the time and length scale of the agent.

The deterministic term $f_i^{(k)}$ captures all specified influences that cause changes to the state variable $u_i^{(k)}$, including interactions with other agents $j \in N$, so it could be a function of the state variables of other agents in addition to external conditions.

## Multi-task and multi-scale problems

A _multi-task_ domain is an environment where an agent performs two or more separate tasks.

A _multi-scale_ domain is a multi-task domain that satisfies the following:

- multiple structural scales: actions are performed across multiple levels of coordination
- interrelated tasks: there is not a strict separation across tasks and the performance in each tasks impacts other tasks
- actions are performed in real-time

More generally, multi-scale problems involve working at many different levels of detail.

For example, an AI for an RTS game must manage many simultaneous goals at the micro and macro level, and these goals and their tasks are often interwoven, and all this must be done in real-time.
