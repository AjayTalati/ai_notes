# In Practice

1. Data is never clean
2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data.
3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning.
4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick.
5. Big Data is just a tool.
6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach.
7. No one cares how you did it.
8. Academia and business are two different worlds.
9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint.
10. All models are wrong, but some are useful.
11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty.

## Data analysis approach

- Clearly and unambiguously define the question you wish to solve
- Determine the ideal dataset for your goal
    - __Descriptive__ - whole population
    - __Exploratory__ - random sample with multiple variables measured
    - __Inferential__ - drawing a conclusion about a larger population from a random sample
    - __Predictive__ - need training and testing data from the same population to build a model and a classifier
    - __Causal__ - experimental data from a randomized study
    - __Mechanistic__ - data from all components of the system you want to describe
- Obtain the data that you need - you may need to pay for it, or generate it yourself
- Clean the data and convert it to a format suitable for your needs
- Exploratory data analysis - become familiar with the data
- Statistical modeling/prediction
- Interpret results, with detailed explanations
- Challenge your results (and entire process), audit the whole thing. Try to come up with alternative analyses, and so on.
- Synthesize and write up your results
- Create reproducible code
