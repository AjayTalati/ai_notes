# Optimization

Optimization is the task of finding the arguments to a function which yield its minimum or maximum value. An optimal argument is denoted with an asterisk, e.g. $x^{\*}$.

In the context of machine learning, we are typically dealing with minimization. If necessary, a maximization problem can be reframed as minimization: to maximize a function $f(x)$, you can instead minimize $-f(x)$.

The function we want to optimize is called the __objective function__. When the particular optimization is minimization, the function may also be referred to as a __cost__, __loss__, or __error__ function.

Optimization problems can be thought of a topology where you are looking for the global peak (if you are maximizing) or the globally lowest point (if you are minimizing). For simplicity, minimizing will be the assumed goal here, as you are often trying to minimize some error function.

![Local vs global minima](assets/local_global_minima.svg textwidth=0.6)

Consider a very naive approach: a greedy random algorithm which starts at some position in this topology, then randomly tries moving to a new position and checks if it is better. If it is, it sets that as the current solution. It continues until it has some reason to stop, usually because it has found a minimum. This is a __local__ minimum; that is, it is a minimum relative to its immediately surrounding points, but it is not necessarily the __global__ minimum, which is the minimum of the entire function.

This algorithm is _greedy_ in that it will always prefer a better scoring position, even if it is only marginally better. Thus it can be easy to get stuck in local optima - since any step away from it seems worse, even if the global optimum is right around the corner, so to speak.

Optimization may be accomplished __numerically__ or __analytically__. The analytic approach involves computing derivatives and then identifying critical points (e.g. the second derivative test). These provide the exact optima.

However, this analytic approach is infeasible for many functions. In such cases we resort to numerical optimization, which involves, in a sense, guessing your way to the optima. The methods covered here are all numerical optimization methods.

Within optimization there are certain special cases:

### Convex optimization

As far as optimization goes, convex optimization is easier to deal with - convex functions have only global minima (any local minimum is a global minimum) without any saddle points.

### Constrained optimization

In optimization we are typically looking to find the optimum across _all_ points. However, we may only be interested in finding the optimum across a subset $S$ of these points - in this case, we have a __constrained optimization__ problem. The points that are in $S$ are called __feasible__ points.

One method for constrained optimization is the __Karush-Kuhn-Tucker__ (KKT) method.

It uses the __generalized Lagrangian__ (sometimes called the generalized Lagrange function).

We must describe $S$ as equations and inequalities; in particular, with $m$ functions $g_i$, called _equality constraints_, and $n$ functions $h_j$, called _inequality constraints_, such that $S = \{\mathbf x | \forall i, g_i(\mathbf x) = 0 \text{and} \forall_j, h_j (\mathbf x) \leq 0 \}$.

For each constraint we also have the variables $\lambda_i, \alpha_i$, called _KKT multipliers_.

Then we can define the generalized Lagrangian as:

$$
L(\mathbf x, \mathbf \lambda, \mathbf \alpha) = f(\mathbf x) + \sigma_i \lambda_i g_i(\mathbf x) + \sigma_j \alpha_j h_j(\mathbf x)
$$

This reframes the constrained minimization problem as an unconstrained optimization of the generalized Lagrangian.

That is, so long as at least one feasible point exists and $f(\mathbf x)$ cannot be $\infty$, then

$$
\min_{\mathbf x} \max_{\mathbf \lambda} \max_{\mathbf \alpha, \mathbf \alpha \geq 0} L(\mathbf x, \mathbf \lambda, \mathbf \alpha)
$$

has the same objective function value and set of optimal points as $\min_{\mathbf x \in S} f(\mathbf x)$.

So long as the constraints are satisfied,

$$
\max_{\mathbf \lambda} \max_{\mathbf \alpha, \mathbf \alpha \geq 0} L(\mathbf x, \mathbf \lambda, \mathbf \alpha) = f(\mathbf x)
$$

and if a constraint is violated, then

$$
\max_{\mathbf \lambda} \max_{\mathbf \alpha, \mathbf \alpha \geq 0} L(\mathbf x, \mathbf \lambda, \mathbf \alpha) = \infty
$$


## Gradient Descent

![Sphere function](assets/spherefunc.svg textwidth=0.5)

__Gradient descent__ (GD) is perhaps the common minimizing optimization (for maximizing, its equivalent is _gradient ascent_) in machine learning.

Say we have a function $C(v)$ which we want to minimize. For simplicity, we will use $v \in \mathbb R^2$. An example $C(v)$ is visualized in the accompanying figure.

In this example, the global minimum is visually obvious, but most of the time it is not (especially when dealing with far more dimensions). But we can apply the model of a ball rolling down a hill and expand it to any arbitrary $n$ dimensions. The ball will "roll" down to a minimum, though not necessarily the global minimum.

The position the ball is at is a potential solution; here it is some values for $v_1$ and $v_2$. We want to move the ball such that $\Delta C$, the change in $C(v)$ from the ball's previous position to the new position, is negative (i.e. the cost function's output is smaller, since we're minimizing).

More formally, $\Delta C$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta C \approx \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_1} \Delta v_1 +
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_2} \Delta v_2
\end{aligned}
$$

We define the _gradient_ of $C$, denoted $\nabla C$, to be the vector of partial derivatives (transposed to be a column vector):

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \nabla C \equiv \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_1},
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_2} \right)^T
\end{aligned}
$$

So we can rewrite $\Delta C$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta C \approx \nabla C \cdot \Delta v.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can choose $\Delta v$ to make $\Delta C$ negative:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta v = -\eta \nabla C,
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $\eta$ is a small, positive parameter (the __learning rate__), which controls the step size.

Finally we have:

$$
\Delta C \approx
-\eta \nabla C \cdot \nabla C = -\eta \|\nabla C\|^2
$$

We can use this to compute a value for $\Delta v$, which is really the change in position for our "ball" to a new position $v'$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v \rightarrow v' = v -\eta \nabla C.
\end{aligned}
$$

And repeat until we hit a global (or local) minimum.

This process is known in particular as __batch gradient descent__ because each step is computed over the entire _batch_ of data.

### Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

With batch gradient descent, the cost function is evaluated on all the training inputs for each step. This can be quite slow.

With __stochastic gradient descent__ (SGD), you randomly shuffle your examples and look at only one example for each iteration of gradient descent. Ultimately it is less direct than batch gradient descent but gets you close to the global minimum - the main advantage is that you're not iterating over your entire training set for each step, so though its path is more wandering, it ends up taking less time on large datasets.

In fact, stochastic gradient descent can help with finding the global minimum because instead of computing over a single error surface, you are working with many different error surfaces varying with the example you are current looking at. So it is possible that in one of these surfaces a local minima does not exist or is less pronounced than in others, which make it easier to surpass.

There's another form of stochastic gradient descent called __minibatch gradient descent__. Here $b$ random examples are used for each iteration, where $b$ is your minibatch size. It is usually in the range of 2-100; a typical choice might be 10. Note that a minibatch size can be _too_ large, resulting in greater time for convergence. But generally it is faster than SGD and has the benefit of aiding in local minima avoidance.

When the stochastic variant is used, a $\frac{1}{b}$ term is sometimes included:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v \rightarrow v' = v -\frac{\eta}{b} \nabla C.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Learning rates

The learning rate $\eta$ is typically held constant. It can be slowly decreased it over time if you want $\theta$ to converge on the global minimum in stochastic gradient descent (otherwise, it just gets close). So for instance, you can divide it by the iteration number plus some constant, but this can be overkill.

### Conditioning

__Conditioning__ describes how much the output of a function varies with small changes in input.

In particular, if we have a function $f(x) = A^{-1}x, A \in R^{n \times n}$, where $A$ has an eigenvalue decomposition, we can compute its __condition number__ as follows:

$$
\max_{i,j} |\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_j}|
$$

Which is the ratio of the magnitude of the largest and smallest eigenvalue; when this is large, we say we have a _poorly conditioned_ matrix since it is overly sensitive to small changes in input. This has the practical implications of slow convergence.

TODO this section needs a bit more:

In the context of gradient descent, if the Hessian is poorly conditioned, then gradient descent does not perform as well. This can be alleviated with __Newton's method__, where a Taylor series expansion is used to approximate $f(x)$ near some point $x_0$, going up to only the second-order derivatives:

$$
f(x) \approx f(x_0) + (x-x_0)^T \nabla x f(x_0) + \frac{1}{2}(x - x_0)^T H(f)(x_0)(x - x_0)
$$

Solving for the critical point gives:

$$
x^{\*} = x_0 - H(f)(x_0)^{-1}\nabla_x f(x_0)
$$

(As a reminder, $H(f)$ is the Hessian of $f$)

Such methods which also use second-order derivatives (i.e. the Hessian) are known as _second-order optimization algorithms_; those that use only the gradient are called _first-order_ optimization algorithms.


## Simulated Annealing

__Simulated annealing__ is similar to the greedy random approach but it has some randomness which can "shake" it out of local optima.

Annealing is a process in metal working where the metal starts at a very high temperature and gradually cools down. Simulated annealing uses a similar process to manage its randomness.

A simulated annealing algorithm starts with a high "_temperature_" (or "energy") which "cools" down (becomes less extreme) as progress is made.
Like the greedy random approach, the algorithm tries a random move. If the move is better, it is accepted as the new position. If the move is worse, then there is a chance it still may be accepted; the probability of this is based on the current temperature, the current error, and the previous error:

$$
P(e, e', T) = \exp(\frac{-(e'-e)}{T})
$$

Each random move, whether accepted or not, is considered an iteration. After each iteration, the temperature is decreased according to a _cooling schedule_. An example cooling schedule is:

$$
T(k) = T_{\text{init}} \frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{init}}}^{\frac{k}{k_{\max}}}
$$

where

- $T_{\text{init}}$ = the starting temperature
- $T_{\text{final}}$ = the minimum/ending temperature
- $k$ = the current iteration
- $k_{\max}$ = the maximum number of iterations

For this particular schedule, you probably don't want to set $T_{\text{final}}$ to 0 since otherwise it would rapidly decrease to 0. Set it something close to 0 instead.

The algorithm terminates when the temperature is at its minimum.

## Nelder-Mead (aka Simplex or Amoeba optimization)

For a problem of $n$ dimensions, create a shape of $n+1$ vertices. This shape is a __simplex__.

One vertex of the simplex is initialized with your best educated guess of the solution vector. That guess could be the output of some other optimization approach, even a previous Nelder-Mead run. If you have nothing to start with, a random vector can be used.

The other $n$ vertices are created by moving in one of the $n$ dimensions by some set amount.

Then at each step of the algorithm, you want to (illustrations are for $n=2$, thus $3$ vertices):

- Find the worst, second worst, and best scoring vertices
- Reflect the worst vertex to some point $p'$ through the best side
- If $p'$ is better, _expand_ by setting the worst vertex to a new point $p''$, a bit further than $p'$ but in the same direction
- If $p'$ is worse, then _contract_ by setting the worst vertex to a new point $p''$, in the same direction as $p'$ but before crossing the best side

![Nelder-Mead](assets/nelder_mead.svg)

The algorithm terminates when one of the following occurs:

- The maximum number of iterations is reached
- The score is "good enough"
- The vertices have become close enough together

Then the best vertex is considered the solution.

This optimization method is very sensitive to how it is initialized; whether or not a good solution is found depends a great deal on its starting points.

## Particle Swarm Optimization

__Particle swarm optimization__ is similar to Nelder-Mead, but instead of three points, many more points are used. These points are called "particles".

Each particle has a position (a potential solution) and a velocity which indicates where the particle moves to in the next iteration. Particles also keep track of their current error to the training examples and its best position so far.

Globally, we also track the best position overall and the lowest error overall.

The velocity for each particle is computed according to:

- it's inertia (i.e. the current direction it is moving in)
- it's historic best position (i.e. the best position it's found so far)
- the global best position

The influence of these components are:

- inertia weight
- cognitive weight (for historic best position)
- social weight (for global best position)

These weights are parameters that must be tuned, but this method is quite robust to them (that is, they are not sensitive to these changes so you don't have to worry too much about getting them just right).

More particles are better, of course, but more intensive.

You can specify the number of epochs (iterations) to run.

You can also incorporate a death-birth cycle in which low-performing particles (those that seem to be stuck, for instance) get destroyed and a new randomly-placed particle is initialized in its place.

## Genetic Algorithms

- You have a _population_ of "_chromosomes_" (e.g. possible solutions or parameters)
- There may be some _mutation_ in the chromosomes (e.g. with binary chromosomes, sometimes 0s become 1s and vice versa or with continuous values, changes happen according to some step size)
- Some chromosomes _crossover_ where the front part of one chromosome combines with the back part of another
- The _genotype_ (the chromosome composition) is expressed as some _phenotype_ (i.e. some genetically-determined properties) in some individuals
- Then each of these individuals has some _fitness_ value resulting from their phenotypes
- These fitnesses are turned into some probability of _survival_
- Then the individuals are _selected_ randomly based on their survival probabilities
- These individuals form the new chromosome population for the next _generation_

Each of these steps requires some decisions by the implementer.

For instance, how do you translate a fitness score into a survival probability?

Well, the simplest way is:

$$
P_i = \frac{f_i}{\sum_i f_i}
$$

Where $f_i$ is the fitness of some individual $i$.

However, depending on how you calculate fitness, this may not be appropriate.

You could alternatively use a ranking method, in which you just look at the relative fitness rankings and not their actual values. So the most fit individual is most likely to survive, the second fit is a bit less likely, and so on.

You pick a probability constant $P_C$, and the survival of the top-ranked individual is $P_C$, that of the second is $(1-P_C)P_C$, that of the third is, $(1-P_C)^2 P_C$, and so on. So $P_{n-1} = (1-P_C)^{n-2}P_C$ and $P_n = (1-P_C)^{n-1}$.

If you get stuck on local maxima you can try increasing the step size. When your populations start to get close to the desired value, you can decrease the step size so the changes are less sporadic (i.e. use simulated annealing).

When selecting a new population, you can incorporate a diversity rank in addition to a fitness rank. This diversity ranking tries to maximize the diversity of the new population. You select one individual for the new population, and then as you select your next individual, you try and find one which is distinct from the already selected individuals.

## Derivative-Free Optimization

Note that Nelder-Mead, Particle Swarm, and genetic algorithm optimization methods are sometimes known as "derivative-free" because they do not involve computing derivatives in order to optimize.
