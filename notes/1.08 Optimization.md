# Optimization

Optimization is the task of finding the arguments to a function which yield its minimum or maximum value.

Optimization problems can be thought of a topology where you are looking for the global peak (if you are maximizing) or the globally lowest point (if you are minimizing). For simplicity, minimizing will be the assumed goal here, as you are often trying to minimize some error function.

![Local vs global minima](assets/local_global_minima.svg textwidth=0.6)

Consider a very naive approach: a greedy random algorithm which starts at some position in this topology, then randomly tries moving to a new position and checks if it is better. If it is, it sets that as the current solution. It continues until it has some reason to stop, usually because it has found a minimum. This is a __local__ minimum; that is, it is a minimum relative to its immediately surrounding points, but it is not necessarily the __global__ minimum, which is the minimum of the entire function.

This algorithm is _greedy_ in that it will always prefer a better scoring position, even if it is only marginally better. Thus it can be easy to get stuck in local optima - since any step away from it seems worse, even if the global optimum is right around the corner, so to speak.


## Gradient Descent

![Sphere function](assets/spherefunc.svg textwidth=0.5)

__Gradient descent__ (GD) is perhaps the common minimizing optimization (for maximizing, its equivalent is _gradient ascent_) in machine learning.

Say we have a function $C(v)$ which we want to minimize. For simplicity, we will use $v \in \mathbb R^2$. An example $C(v)$ is visualized in the accompanying figure.

In this example, the global minimum is visually obvious, but most of the time it is not (especially when dealing with far more dimensions). But we can apply the model of a ball rolling down a hill and expand it to any arbitrary $n$ dimensions. The ball will "roll" down to a minimum, though not necessarily the global minimum.

The position the ball is at is a potential solution; here it is some values for $v_1$ and $v_2$. We want to move the ball such that $\Delta C$, the change in $C(v)$ from the ball's previous position to the new position, is negative (i.e. the cost function's output is smaller, since we're minimizing).

More formally, $\Delta C$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta C \approx \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_1} \Delta v_1 +
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_2} \Delta v_2
\end{aligned}
$$

We define the _gradient_ of $C$, denoted $\nabla C$, to be the vector of partial derivatives (transposed to be a column vector):

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \nabla C \equiv \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_1},
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial v_2} \right)^T
\end{aligned}
$$

So we can rewrite $\Delta C$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta C \approx \nabla C \cdot \Delta v.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can choose $\Delta v$ to make $\Delta C$ negative:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Delta v = -\eta \nabla C,
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $\eta$ is a small, positive parameter (the __learning rate__), which controls the step size.

Finally we have:

$$
\Delta C \approx
-\eta \nabla C \cdot \nabla C = -\eta \|\nabla C\|^2
$$

We can use this to compute a value for $\Delta v$, which is really the change in position for our "ball" to a new position $v'$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v \rightarrow v' = v -\eta \nabla C.
\end{aligned}
$$

And repeat until we hit a global (or local) minimum.

This process is known in particular as __batch gradient descent__ because each step is computed over the entire _batch_ of data.

### Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

With batch gradient descent, the cost function is evaluated on all the training inputs for each step. This can be quite slow.

With __stochastic gradient descent__ (SGD), you randomly shuffle your examples and look at only one example for each iteration of gradient descent. Ultimately it is less direct than batch gradient descent but gets you close to the global minimum - the main advantage is that you're not iterating over your entire training set for each step, so though its path is more wandering, it ends up taking less time on large datasets.

There's another form of stochastic gradient descent called __mini-batch gradient descent__. Here $b$ random examples are used for each iteration, where $b$ is your mini-batch size. It is usually in the range of 2-100; a typical choice might be 10.

When the stochastic variant is used, a $\frac{1}{b}$ term is sometimes included:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v \rightarrow v' = v -\frac{\eta}{b} \nabla C.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Learning rates

The learning rate $\eta$ is typically held constant. It can be slowly decreased it over time if you want $\theta$ to converge on the global minimum in stochastic gradient descent (otherwise, it just gets close). So for instance, you can divide it by the iteration number plus some constant, but this can be overkill.


## Simulated Annealing

__Simulated annealing__ is similar to the greedy random approach but it has some randomness which can "shake" it out of local optima.

Annealing is a process in metal working where the metal starts at a very high temperature and gradually cools down. Simulated annealing uses a similar process to manage its randomness.

A simulated annealing algorithm starts with a high "_temperature_" (or "energy") which "cools" down (becomes less extreme) as progress is made.
Like the greedy random approach, the algorithm tries a random move. If the move is better, it is accepted as the new position. If the move is worse, then there is a chance it still may be accepted; the probability of this is based on the current temperature, the current error, and the previous error:

$$
P(e, e', T) = \exp(\frac{-(e'-e)}{T})
$$

Each random move, whether accepted or not, is considered an iteration. After each iteration, the temperature is decreased according to a _cooling schedule_. An example cooling schedule is:

$$
T(k) = T_{\text{init}} \frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{init}}}^{\frac{k}{k_{\max}}}
$$

where

- $T_{\text{init}}$ = the starting temperature
- $T_{\text{final}}$ = the minimum/ending temperature
- $k$ = the current iteration
- $k_{\max}$ = the maximum number of iterations

For this particular schedule, you probably don't want to set $T_{\text{final}}$ to 0 since otherwise it would rapidly decrease to 0. Set it something close to 0 instead.

The algorithm terminates when the temperature is at its minimum.

## Nelder-Mead (aka Simplex or Amoeba optimization)

For a problem of $n$ dimensions, create a shape of $n+1$ vertices. This shape is a __simplex__.

One vertex of the simplex is initialized with your best educated guess of the solution vector. That guess could be the output of some other optimization approach, even a previous Nelder-Mead run. If you have nothing to start with, a random vector can be used.

The other $n$ vertices are created by moving in one of the $n$ dimensions by some set amount.

Then at each step of the algorithm, you want to (illustrations are for $n=2$, thus $3$ vertices):

- Find the worst, second worst, and best scoring vertices
- Reflect the worst vertex to some point $p'$ through the best side
- If $p'$ is better, _expand_ by setting the worst vertex to a new point $p''$, a bit further than $p'$ but in the same direction
- If $p'$ is worse, then _contract_ by setting the worst vertex to a new point $p''$, in the same direction as $p'$ but before crossing the best side

![Nelder-Mead](assets/nelder_mead.svg)

The algorithm terminates when one of the following occurs:

- The maximum number of iterations is reached
- The score is "good enough"
- The vertices have become close enough together

Then the best vertex is considered the solution.

This optimization method is very sensitive to how it is initialized; whether or not a good solution is found depends a great deal on its starting points.

## Particle Swarm Optimization

__Particle swarm optimization__ is similar to Nelder-Mead, but instead of three points, many more points are used. These points are called "particles".

Each particle has a position (a potential solution) and a velocity which indicates where the particle moves to in the next iteration. Particles also keep track of their current error to the training examples and its best position so far.

Globally, we also track the best position overall and the lowest error overall.

The velocity for each particle is computed according to:

- it's inertia (i.e. the current direction it is moving in)
- it's historic best position (i.e. the best position it's found so far)
- the global best position

The influence of these components are:

- inertia weight
- cognitive weight (for historic best position)
- social weight (for global best position)

These weights are parameters that must be tuned, but this method is quite robust to them (that is, they are not sensitive to these changes so you don't have to worry too much about getting them just right).

More particles are better, of course, but more intensive.

You can specify the number of epochs (iterations) to run.

You can also incorporate a death-birth cycle in which low-performing particles (those that seem to be stuck, for instance) get destroyed and a new randomly-placed particle is initialized in its place.
