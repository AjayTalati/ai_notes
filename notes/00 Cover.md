These are my notes which are broadly intended to cover the basics necessary for data science and artificial intelligence. They have been collected from a variety of different sources, which I include as references when I remember to - so take this as a disclaimer that most of this material is adapted, sometimes directly copied, from elsewhere. Maybe it's better to call this a "remix" sampled from resources elsewhere. Or a Katamari of notes. I have tried to give credit where it is due, but sometimes I forget to include all my references, so I will generally just say that I take no credit for any material here.

Many of the graphics and illustrations are of my own creation, but plenty have also been sourced from elsewhere - again, I have tried to give credit where it is due, but some things slip through.

Data science and artificial intelligence are two huge fields that share some foundational overlap but go in quite different directions. These notes are not comprehensive but aim to cover a significant portion of that common ground (and a bit beyond too). These notes function more as a reference than a detailed examination of these concepts - so almost all proofs are omitted; if you are interested in them there are many other resources which will help with that.

Since mathematical concepts typically have many different applications and interpretations and often are arrived at through different disciplines and perspectives, I try to explain these concepts in as many ways as possible.

__Note that this is still very much a work in progress and it will be changing a lot! A lot may be out of order, missing, littered with TO DOs, etc.__
